# OptiArm2DOF
OptiArm2DOF is a project that utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the lengths of the two segments of a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robotic arm.

# Description
OptiArm2DOF is a project that utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the lengths of the two segments of a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robotic arm. The goal is to ensure that the arm can reach objects within a specified range, from a minimum to a maximum distance from its base.
